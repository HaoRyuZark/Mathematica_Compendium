\section{Sequences and Series}

A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, usually defined by a formula or a recurrence relation. It is 
one of the fundamental objects of study in mathematical analysis.

\subsection{Arithmetic Sequence}

An \emph{arithmetic sequence} is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

\[
    a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
\]

\begin{itemize}

    \item \(a_1\) is the first term

    \item \(d\) is the common difference \(d = a_{n + 1} - a_{n}\)

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

\[
    a_n = 3 + (n - 1) \cdot 2 = 2n + 1 \quad \text{(Odd numbers)}
\]

\subsection{Geometric Sequence}

A \emph{geometric sequence} is a sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term 
by a fixed non-zero constant.

\[
    a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
\]

\begin{itemize}

    \item \(a_1\) is the first term

    \item \(r\) is the common ratio \(r = \frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}\)

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

\[
    a_n = 2 \cdot 3^{n-1} = 2, 6, 18, 54, \dots
\]

\subsection{Function Sequence}

A \emph{function sequence} is sequence composed of functions and its noted like:

\[
    {(f)}_n \text{with } x^t := \{ f: D\to R | \ f \text{ is a function}\}
\]

\subsection{Convergence}

A sequence \((a_n)\) \emph{converges} to a limit \(L\) if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists an 
integer \(n_0\) such that for all \(n \ge n_0\):

\[
    \forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists n \in \Naturals: \forall i \ge n\ |a_i - L| < \varepsilon
\]

In this case, we write:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L
\]

\subsection{Cauchy Sequence}

A sequence \((a_n)\) is a \emph{Cauchy sequence} if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists an 
integer \(n_0\) such that for all \(n, m \ge n_0\):

\[
    \forall \varepsilon > 0\ \exists n,m \in \Naturals: |a_n - a_m| < \varepsilon\ \text{with } n < m
\]

Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. In complete metric spaces (like \(\Reals\)), the 
converse also holds.

\textbf{Example: Convergence Exercise}

Let \(a_i = \frac{1}{i}\) and \(\varepsilon = 0.01\). We want to find \(i_0\) such that:

\[
    \left|\frac{1}{n} - 0\right| < \varepsilon \implies \frac{1}{i} \le \frac{1}{n} < \varepsilon \rightarrow \frac{1}{\varepsilon} < n
\]
\[
    \Rightarrow \frac{1}{i} < 0.01 \Rightarrow i > 100
    \Rightarrow i_0 = 101
\]

\subsection{Definition of \texorpdfstring{\(\varepsilon\)}{ε}-Neighborhood}

The \emph{\(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood} of a point \(a \in \Reals\) is the set:

\[
    B_\varepsilon(a) = \{x \in \Reals \mid |x - a| < \varepsilon\}
\]

This is the open interval \((a - \varepsilon, a + \varepsilon)\).

\subsection{Supremum, Infimum, Maximum and Minimum}

The \emph{supremum} \(\text{sup}\) of a set \(A \subseteq \Reals\) is the 
least upper bound: the smallest real number \(s\) such that \(a \le s\) for all \(a \in A\).

\[
    x \le s, \forall x \in A 
\]

\[
    x \le s', \forall x \in A \implies s' \ge s
\]


The \emph{maximum} is the largest element in the set, if it exists.

The \emph{minimum} is the smallest element in the set, if it exists.

Finally we define \(\text{sup} \emptyset := - \infty\) and \(\text{inf} \emptyset := +\infty\)

\textbf{Example I:}

For \(A = (0,1)\):

\begin{itemize}

    \item \(\sup A = 1\) (not in \(A\))

    \item \(\inf A = 0\) (not in \(A\))

    \item \(\max A\) and \(\min A\) do not exist

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example II:}

For \((0, 5)\) and \((0,5]\), the supremum is 5.

\textbf{Example III:}

For the real numbers we can define \(\sqrt{2}\) as the supremum of the set \(\{x \in \Reals \mid x^2 < 2\}\).

The \emph{infimum} \(\text{inf}\) of a set \(A\) is the greatest lower bound: 
the largest number \(t\) such that \(a \ge t\) for all \(a \in A\). 

\[
    x \ge s, \forall x \in A 
\]

\[
    x \ge s', \forall x \in A \implies s' \le s
\]
\subsubsection{Alternative Characterization of the Supremum}

Given a non-empty set \(A \subseteq \Reals\). The \(s \in Reals\) is only a supremum of \(A\) if 

\[
    (\nexists s \in A, s < x) \land (s' \in \Reals, s' < s \implies !\exists x \in A, x > s')
\]

\subsection{Properties of Suprema and Infima}

For non-empty sets \(A, B \subseteq \Reals^+\)

\begin{itemize}

    \item \(\sup AB = \sup A \cdot \sup B\)

    \item \(\inf AB = \inf A \cdot \inf B\)

    \item \(\sup (A + B) = \sup A + \sup B \)

    \item \(\inf (A + B) = \inf A + \inf B \)

    \item \(\sup (A / B) = \sup(A) / \inf(B)\)
     
    \item \(\sup (-A) = - \inf A\)

    \item \(\inf (-A) = - \sup A\)

\end{itemize}

For the sake of completeness we will prove one of these properties: 

\textbf{Proof:}

By definition \(\forall ab \in AB\) the following holds: 

\[
    ab \le \sup A \cdot \sup B \implies \sup AB \le \sup A \cdot \sup B
\]

Because \(\sup A\) and \(\sup B\) not necessarily belong to \(A\) or \(B\). With this, we already have the 
half of the proof. Now we need to prove that \(\sup AB \ge \sup A \cdot \sup B\). 

Start with 

\begin{align*}
    ab &\le \sup AB \\ 
    a &\le \frac{\sup AB}{b} 
\end{align*}

Therefore, \(\frac{\sup AB}{b}\) is an upper bound of \(A\). This means that: 

\[
    \sup A \le \frac{\sup AB}{b} \implies \sup A \cdot b \le \sup AB
\]

From this we can also derive that 

\[
    \sup A \cdot b \le \sup AB \implies b \le \frac{\sup AB}{\sup A}
\]

Thus, because \(\frac{\sup AB}{\sup A}\) is an upper bound of \(B\) we have that:

\[
    \sup B \le \frac{\sup AB}{\sup A} \implies \sup A \cdot \sup B \le \sup AB
\]

Combining both parts of the proof we have that:

\[
    \sup AB = \sup A \cdot \sup B
\]

\QED 

The other proofs can be proven using similar arguments.

\subsection{Limit and Accumulation Point}

\begin{itemize}

    \item A \emph{limit} of a sequence \((a_n)\) is the value the terms get arbitrarily close to as 
    \(n \to \infty\).

    \item An \emph{accumulation point} (or limit point) of a set \(A\) is a point \(x\) such that every 
    neighborhood of \(x\) contains infinitely many points of \(A\).

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

The sequence \(a_n = {(-1)}^n + \frac{1}{n}\) has two accumulation points: \(1\) and \(-1\).

\subsection{Monotonicity by Difference and Quotient}

\emph{Monotonicity by Difference:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item If \(a_{n+1} - a_n \ge 0\) for all \(n\), then the sequence is non-decreasing.

    \item If \(a_{n+1} - a_n < 0\), it is non-increasing.

\end{itemize}

\emph{Monotonicity by Quotient:} (Typically for positive sequences)

\begin{itemize}

    \item If \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \ge 1\), then the sequence is non-decreasing.

    \item If \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} < 1\), it is non-increasing.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Divergence (Definition)}

A sequence \emph{diverges} if it does not converge. That is, there is no real number \(L\) such that:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L
\]

\begin{itemize}

    \item A sequence can diverge to \(\infty\) or \(-\infty\)

    \item A sequence can also oscillate without approaching any limit

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

The sequence \(a_n = {(-1)}^n\) diverges since it oscillates between \(1\) and \(-1\).

\subsection{Subsequences and Their Properties}

A \emph{subsequence} of a sequence \((a_n)\) is a sequence \((a_{n_k})\) where \((n_k)\) is a strictly 
increasing sequence of natural numbers.

\textbf{Properties:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit.

    \item A sequence converges if and only if all of its subsequences converge to the same limit.

    \item A bounded sequence always has at least one convergent subsequence (Bolzano-Weierstraß theorem).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Series}

A \emph{series} is the sum of the terms of a sequence:

\[
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
\]

We define the partial sums \(S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k\). If the sequence \((S_n)\) converges to a limit \(S\), then the series is said to converge:

\[
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = S
\]

\subsection{Power Series}

A \emph{power series} is a series of the form:

\[
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n {(x - x_0)}^n
\]

Where \(x_0\) is the center of the expansion. Power series converge within a radius \emph{R}:

\[
    R = \frac{1}{\limsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}}
\]

\subsection{Geometric Series}

There two types of \emph{geometric series}.

\emph{1. Finite geometric series:}

\[
    \sum_{n = 0}^{r - 1} aq^n = a \cdot \frac{1 - q^r}{1 - q} \quad \text{for } q \ne 1
\]

\emph{2. Infinite geometric series:}

\[
    \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} aq^n = \frac{a}{1 - q} \quad \text{for } |q| < 1
\]

\subsection{Point-wise Convergence}

A sequence of functions \((f_n)\) converges \emph{point-wise} to a function \(f\) on a set \(A\) if:

\[
    \forall x \in A, \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)
\]

Point-wise convergence does not preserve properties like continuity or differentiability.

\subsection{Uniform Convergence}

A sequence of functions \((f_n)\) converges \emph{uniformly} to \(f\) on \(A\) if:

\[
    \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists n_0 \in \Naturals \text{ such that } \forall n \ge n_0, \forall x \in A, \quad |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon
\]

\emph{Key Property:} Uniform convergence preserves continuity, integration, and differentiation under 
certain conditions.

\subsection{Cauchy Criterion for Series}

A series \(\sum a_n\) converges if and only if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists \(n_0\) 
such that:

\[
    \left| \sum_{k = m}^{n} a_k \right| < \varepsilon \quad \forall n > m \ge n_0
\]

\subsection{Interval Nesting and the Interval Nesting Theorem}

Let \((I_n)\) be a sequence of closed intervals:

\[
    I_n = [a_n, b_n] \quad \text{with } I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n, \text{ and } \lim_{n \to \infty} (b_n - a_n) = 0
\]

Then, the intersection contains exactly one point:

\[
    \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n = \{x\}
\]

This is useful in proving the existence of limits, roots, and fixed points.

\subsection{Weierstraß Approximation Theorem}

The \emph{Weierstraß Approximation Theorem} states:

Every continuous function \(f: [a, b] \rightarrow \Reals\) can be uniformly approximated by a 
polynomial \(P(x)\), i.e., for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a polynomial \(P(x)\) such that:

\[
    |f(x) - P(x)| < \varepsilon \quad \forall x \in [a, b]
\]

This theorem is foundational in numerical analysis and approximation theory.

\subsection{Zero Sequence}

A sequence \((a_n)\) is called a \emph{null sequence} or \emph{zero sequence} if:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0
\]

Every zero sequence is convergent (to 0), and plays an essential role in convergence proofs and 
epsilon-delta arguments.

\subsection{The Monotony Principle}

Every bounded monotonic sequence converges.

\begin{itemize}

    \item If \((a_n)\) is non-decreasing and bounded above, then \(\lim a_n\) exists and equals 
    \(\sup \{a_n\}\).

    \item If \((a_n)\) is non-increasing and bounded below, then \(\lim a_n = \inf \{a_n\}\).

\end{itemize}

To prove the convergence of a sequence via this principle we follow the next steps

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Prove the Monotonicity by induction

    \item Calculate the limit

    \item Prove the limitedness via induction

    \item Write the conclusion

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example:} 

\(a_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2a_n - 3} + 1\)

Let us assume that the series is decreasing or \(a_{n + 1} < a_{n}\)

\begin{align*}
    a_{n + 2} &< a_{n + 1} \\
    \sqrt{2a_{n + 1} -3} + 1 &< \sqrt{2a_{n} - 3} + 1 \\
    \sqrt{2a_{n + 1} -3} &< \sqrt{2a_{n} - 3} \\
    2a_{n + 1} - 3 &< 2a_{n} - 3 \\
    a_{n + 1} &< a_{n}
\end{align*}

\QED

Now let us calculated the limit

\[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n + 1} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{2a_n - 3} + 1
\]

Because of the recursion we know that both \(a_{n + 1}\) and \(a_n\) have the same value, 
and we call it \(a\).

\[
    a = \sqrt{2a -3} +1
\]
\[
    a = 2
\]

We only have to prove the limitedness now:

For \(n = 0\) we have \(a_1 = 4 > 2\) then let us assume that the \(a\) is never going bellow 2.

\[
    a_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2a_n - 3} + 1 \ge \sqrt{2(2) - 3} + 1 = 2
\]

By setting \(a_n = 2\) we get the limit again

\QED

\subsection{Operations on Sequences}

\subsubsection{Sum of Sequences}

The sum of two sequences \((a_n)\) and \((b_n)\) is a new sequence \((c_n)\) where each term 
\(c_n\) is the sum of the corresponding terms of \((a_n)\) and \((b_n)\):

\[
    c_n = a_n + b_n, \quad \forall n \in \Naturals.
\]

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A\) and \(\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = B\), then the limit of the sum sequence is:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) = A + B.
\]

\subsubsection{Multiplication of Sequences}

The product of two sequences \((a_n)\) and \((b_n)\) is a new sequence \((d_n)\) where each term \(d_n\) 
is the product of the corresponding terms of \((a_n)\) and \((b_n)\):

\[
    d_n = a_n \cdot b_n, \quad \forall n \in \Naturals.
\]

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A\) and \(\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = B\), then the limit of the product sequence is:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n \cdot b_n) = A \cdot B.
\]

\subsubsection{Absolute Value of a Sequence}

The absolute value of a sequence \((a_n)\) is a new sequence \((e_n)\) where each term \(e_n\) is the absolute value of the corresponding term of \((a_n)\):

\[
    e_n = |a_n|, \quad \forall n \in \Naturals.
\]

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A\), then the limit of the absolute value sequence is:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} |a_n| = |A|.
\]

\subsubsection{Conjugate of a Complex Sequence}

If \((a_n)\) is a sequence of complex numbers, where \(a_n = x_n + i y_n\) with \(x_n, y_n \in \Reals\), then the conjugate of \((a_n)\) is a new sequence \((\overline{a_n})\) where each term \(\overline{a_n}\) is the complex conjugate of \(a_n\):

\[
    \overline{a_n} = x_n - i y_n, \quad \forall n \in \Naturals.
\]

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A = X + i Y\), then the limit of the conjugate sequence is:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \overline{a_n} = \overline{A} = X - i Y.
\]

\subsubsection{Complex Limit (Real and Imaginary Parts)}

For a sequence of complex numbers \((a_n)\) where \(a_n = x_n + i y_n\), the limit of the sequence 
\(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A = X + i Y\) exists if and only if the limits of the real part sequence 
\((x_n)\) and the imaginary part sequence \((y_n)\) exist individually:

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = A \iff \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{Re}(a_n) = \text{Re}(A) = X \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} \img(a_n) = \img(A) = Y \right).
\]

This means we can analyze the convergence of a complex sequence by examining the convergence of its real 
and imaginary parts separately.

\subsubsection{Asymptotic Equality}

Two sequences \({(a_n)}_{n \in \Naturals}\) and \({(b_n)}_{n \in \Naturals}\) are said to be 
asymptotically equal, denoted by \(a_n \sim b_n\), if

\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = 1,
\]

provided that \(b_n \neq 0\) for all sufficiently large \(n\). Asymptotic equality implies that the sequences behave similarly as \(n\) approaches infinity.
